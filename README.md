This repository formerly contained a fork of Robert Picard's Stata program `project`, containing various adaptations that I found useful in my own work. Robert has [politely asked](https://www.statalist.org/forums/forum/general-stata-discussion/general/1467479-project-by-robert-picard-running-individual-do-files?p=1719270#post1719270) that I take down this repository:
> I own the copyrights to my work and I do not grant licenses to distribute my work. I therefore request that you remove from your github site all files that include any subset of my code.

I remain grateful that Robert has written and made `project` available to all Stata users, and I continue to use it in my work.

As the creator of the software, Robert has sole discretion to control the distribution of his work and restrict the creation of derivative work. You can access the published version via the [Stata SSC](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s457685.html). If you have any questions, please feel free to email me.
